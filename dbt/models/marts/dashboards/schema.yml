      **Flow-Based Indicator Progress Model for Multi-Visualization Support.**

      **Grain:** One row per indicator × snapshot_number × is_last × max_wave_reached
      × baseline_label × previous_label × current_label × organization.

      **Use Case:** Supports Sankey diagrams, line charts, bar charts, and cohort analysis
      from a single table by preserving transition information (baseline→previous→current).

      **Key Insight:** Unlike wide tables with status counts, this flow-based design
      preserves the connection between start and end states for Sankey visualization.

      **Key Features:**
      - Transition columns: baseline_label, previous_label, current_label
      - Cohort filtering via max_wave_reached (survivor curves)
      - Pre-aggregated family_count for fast queries
      - net_change_numeric for avg improvement calculations
      - RLS-enabled via application_id

      **BI Usage Patterns:**
      - Sankey: baseline_label (source) → current_label (target) → SUM(family_count) WHERE is_last = TRUE
      - Line Chart: % Green = SUM(family_count) FILTER (WHERE current_label = 'Green') / SUM(family_count)
      - Bar Chart: Compare GROUP BY baseline_label vs GROUP BY current_label
      - Survivor Curve: WHERE max_wave_reached >= N
