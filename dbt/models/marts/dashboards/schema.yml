      **Pre-Aggregated Indicator Model for Time-Series Analysis.**

      **Grain:** One row per indicator × snapshot_type × organization dimensions

      **Use Case:** Time-series charts showing Green/Yellow/Red counts across
      Baseline, 1st Follow-up, 2nd Follow-up, etc. Pre-aggregated for fast queries.

      **Key Features:**
      - Pre-computed counts (green_count, yellow_count, red_count, skipped_count)
      - Long structure with snapshot_type column for time-series
      - Canonical English indicator_name for cross-survey grouping
      - Indicator details for tooltips
      - Indexed for dashboard performance

      **BI Usage Patterns:**
      - Time-series % Green: green_count / total_responses by snapshot_type
      - Dimension breakdown: Group by dimension_name or indicator_name
      - Cohort filtering: Filter by hub_name, organization_name, survey_title
      - Use snapshot_sequence for sorting (1, 2, 3, ...)

      **Pre-aggregated Indicator Transitions for Sankey Diagrams.**

      **Grain:** One row per (dimension columns) × baseline_label × latest_label.

      **Use Case:** Analyze which poverty indicators are improving or worsening
      across the portfolio. Pre-aggregated for fast Sankey diagrams and dashboard queries.

      - Only includes indicators present in BOTH baseline AND latest snapshots
      - Skipped indicators (NULL values) are excluded
      - Pre-aggregated counts for fast dashboard performance

      - RLS-enabled via application_id

      **BI Usage Patterns:**
      - Sankey diagram: Source=baseline_label, Target=latest_label, Metric=SUM(indicator_count)
      - Transition bar chart: Group by transition_type, Metric=SUM(indicator_count)
      - Impact by indicator: Filter transition_type, Group by indicator_name
