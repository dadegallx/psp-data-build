  # FACT TABLES
  # ========================================

  - name: fact_family_indicator_snapshot
    description: >
      Main fact table capturing poverty indicator assessments at atomic grain.

      **Grain:** One row per family, per indicator, per snapshot (survey completion).

      **Row Count:** Estimated 225,000 current rows, growing by ~75K per 1,000 new families.

      **Usage:** This table supports all 20 business questions defined in BUSINESS_QUESTIONS_DOCS.md
      by enabling analysis at family-indicator-snapshot level and aggregation to family-snapshot level.

      **Key Patterns:**
      - Current status: Filter WHERE is_last = TRUE
      - Baseline surveys: Filter WHERE snapshot_number = 1
      - Progress analysis: Compare snapshot_number = 1 vs > 1 for same family

  - name: fact_family_economic_snapshot
    description: >
      Fact table capturing economic survey responses at atomic grain using a normalized design.

      **Grain:** One row per family, per economic question, per snapshot (survey completion).

      **Design Pattern:** Normalized (like fact_family_indicator_snapshot) - questions are rows, not columns.
      Each economic question response is stored as a separate row with typed value columns.

      **Scope:** All economic questions (both family-level and member-level).

      **Typed Value Columns:** Based on answer_type, responses are stored in the appropriate column:
      - value_text: text/select/radio responses; checkbox values as pipe-separated
      - value_number: numeric responses
      - value_date: date responses (converted from milliseconds epoch)

      **Data Quality Note:** Filters out orphaned code_names (responses without
      matching survey_economic definitions) via inner join.

      **Row Count:** Estimated 50,000-200,000 rows (all economic questions captured).

      Enriched indicator fact table with window function columns for progress analysis.

      **Grain:** One row per family × indicator × snapshot.

      Adds baseline_score and previous_score via window functions partitioned by
      family_id + survey_indicator_id, enabling:
      - Sankey diagrams (baseline → current transitions)
      - Progress analysis (current_score - baseline_score)
      - Momentum tracking (current_score - previous_score)

      **Key Patterns:**
      - Sankey diagrams: Filter WHERE is_last = TRUE, map baseline_score → current_score
      - Progress from start: SELECT *, (current_score - baseline_score) as change
      - Recent momentum: SELECT *, (current_score - previous_score) as momentum
